6- Let the program run and it will notifies you when the time for a task is over.

## How the timer works:
Let's say you have 2 tasks and you enter a 1 minute timer for each of them... the timer will first notifies you after 1 minute for the first task and then notifies you 2 minutes after you registered for the second task.
Summary: Each minute and/or hour appends on the first one.
